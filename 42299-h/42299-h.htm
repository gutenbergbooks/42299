interesting Object in the latter of those Volumes;
and it is written in the same style and manner,

by the Pencil of <span class="smcap">Mr. Rowlandson</span> with its
accustomed characteristic Felicity.</p>

through the whole of this Volume; which must be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
considered as fortunate in no common degree, if its
readers, in the course of their perusal, should be
disposed to acknowledge even a remote Similitude

<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HIS prolonged work is, at length, brought to
a close.&mdash;It has grown to this size, under
rare and continuing marks of public favour; while
the same mode of Composition has been employed
in the last, as in the former Volumes. They are
all equally indebted to <span class="smcap">Mr. Rowlandson's</span> talents.</p>

<p>It may, perhaps, be considered as presumption
in me, and at my age, to sport even with my own
Dowdy Muse, but, from the extensive patronage
which <span class="smcap">Doctor Syntax</span> has received, it may be
presumed that, more or less, he has continued to
amuse: And I, surely, have no reason to be dissatisfied,
when Time points at my eightieth Year,
that I can still afford some pleasure to those who
are disposed to be pleased.</p>

Which Heaven gave him to inherit,<br />
Fondly embrac'd me as his own;<br />
But ere three transient years were gone,<br />
I lost my friend, but found another,<br />
A father he, and she, a mother;<br />
For such at least they both have prov'd,<br />
And as their child the stranger lov'd.<br />
O, rest her soul!&mdash;to her 'tis given<br />
To share his happy lot in Heaven.<br />
I seem'd to be her utmost pride,<br />
And Johnny trotting by her side,<br />
Fill'd with delight her glancing eye<br />
In warm affection's sympathy.<br />
This fond, this kind, this fost'ring friend<br />
Did to my ev'ry want attend;<br />
Her only fault, she rather spoil'd<br />
As he grew up, the darling child;<br />
But though her care was not confin'd<br />
Or to his body, or his mind,<br />
Though, with a fond parental view,<br />
She gave to both th' attention due,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span><br />
Ne'er would she her displeasure fix<br />
On his most wild, unlucky tricks.<br />
So that at church he held grave airs,<br />
Pronounc'd Amen, and said his pray'rs,<br />
And on a Sunday evening read<br />
A sermon ere they went to bed,<br />
Throughout the week, he was quite free<br />
For mischief with impunity.<br />
&mdash;If on the folk I squirted water,<br />
How she would shake her sides with laughter;<br />
If the long-rotten eggs were thrown<br />
At Mary, Sally, or at Joan;<br />
If any stinging stuff was put<br />
Into the hasty trav'ller's boot;<br />
If the sly movement of the heel<br />
Should overturn the spinning-wheel.<br />
&mdash;If holly plac'd beside the rose<br />
Should wound the gay sheep-shearer's nose,<br />
Or 'neath the tail a thorn-bush pricking,<br />
Should set Dame Dobbins' mare a kicking,<br />
And overthrow the market load,<br />
While beans and peas o'erspread the road,<br />
If the poor injur'd made complaint<br />
To Madam of her wily saint,<br />
She would reply, 'pray cease your noise,<br />
These are the tricks of clever boys,<br />
It is my pleasant Johnny's fun,<br />
Tell me the damage, and have done.'<br />
&mdash;When I became a rosy boy,<br />
My growth encreas'd her growing joy;<br />
But now such gamesome hours were o'er<br />
I play'd my childish tricks no more.<br />
My little heart 'gan to beat high,<br />
And with heroic ardor try<br />
The tempting danger to pursue,<br />
And do what others could not do:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span><br />
I sought to climb the highest tree,<br />
Where none would dare to follow me,<br />
Or the gay sporting horse to ride,<br />
Which no school-fellow dare bestride.<br />
My feats were sometimes rather scaring,<br />
But the Dame lov'd to see me daring;<br />
As by my running, leaping, walking,<br />
I us'd to set the parish talking,<br />
And, to the good old women's wonder,<br />
I fear'd not lightning nor thunder.</td>

I shar'd the pinch, and he ne'er ceas'd<br />

Nay, when my snortings I repeated,<br />

'My friend, familiarize your nose<br />

You all well know I paid his bills,<br />

<div class="line">At all events, he could but try</div>
<div class="line">This self-same scheme of quackery:</div>
<div class="line">At least some knowledge he should gain,</div>
<div class="line">And knowledge never comes in vain.</div>
<div class="line">Indeed, what harm, if he succeed in</div>
<div class="line">The arts of cupping and of bleeding?</div>
<div class="line">The lancet's power to command</div>

<td class="tdl"><span class="i1h">  But now, a Fair One will appear,</span><br />
About her four-and-twentieth year;<br />
Though, whatsoe'er may be her age,<br />
She must be brought upon the stage,<br />
Blooming and gay and form'd to please,<br />
By the old man was call'd his niece,<br />
And, though there were some doubts we know,<br />
It turn'd out she was truly so.<br />
All saw that he was fond of Miss,<br />
Would often give and take a kiss,<br />
And even with his money part,<br />
To purchase smiles and make her smart.<br />
Abroad she was not us'd to roam<br />
But Novels read and stay'd at home.<br />
The pantry's boon, so lean and spare,<br />
Was forc'd on her unwilling care;<br />
For when Old Avarice complain'd<br />
Of the great cost his life sustain'd,<br />
He ne'er forgot, 'mong human ills,<br />
The baker's and the butcher's bills:<br />
But 'twas her interest to be<br />
The slave of his &oelig;conomy.<br />
&mdash;An errand-man and one poor maid,<br />
Were all who gave the household aid:<br />
They were to am'rous purpose bent<br />
So fed on love and were content;<br />

Which was his fount of <em>Milk</em> and <em>Honey</em>;<br />
His easy stomach never car'd<br />
How lean the joint on which he far'd.<br />
&mdash;It was his interest to agree,<br />
In all things with Miss <span class="smcap">Emily</span>,<br />
As she could humour Uncle <span class="smcap">Squeeze</span>,<br />
And now and then possess the keys:<br />
Nor could she shape her main design<br />
Unless <span class="smcap">Quæ Genus</span> would combine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span><br />
The hobbling <i>Old One</i> to deceive,<br />
And let in <i>Friends</i> without his leave.<br />
She gave him physic, tuck'd his bed,<br />
The pillow smooth'd to rest his head;<br />
Then all around the curtains drew,<br />
And having spoke the night's adieu,<br />
Would gaily hasten down below<br />
To smile upon the favour'd beau<br />
Whom her commanding Billet-doux<br />
Had summon'd to an interview.<br />
From Uncle <span class="smcap">John</span>'s great hoard of wealth,<br />
And the old man's declining health,<br />
'Twas thought she soon would be a prize<br />
Which smart young men might idolize;<br />
That a great fortune Miss would be<br />
From heirdom or by legacy:<br />
While lovers, therefore, not a few,<br />
Had pass'd before her in review,<br />
Her kind warm heart might not disown<br />
That she had fix'd her thoughts on one;<br />
And he it was who had the power<br />
To share with her an evening hour.<br />
But to the point, which even love<br />
Could not from her keen thoughts remove:<br />
The Lady did not long delay<br />
Thus the prime secret to convey,<br />
"I have a precious plan, <span class="smcap">Quæ Genus</span>,<br />
And if 'tis manag'd well between us,<br />
We may, as I know how, contrive,<br />v
To make our mutual int'rests thrive.<br />
I have already something done,<br />
As you will hear, for <em>Number ONE</em>,<br />
And there's another scheme will do,<br />
As you will know, for <em>Number TWO</em>.<br />
My uncle's wealth is that of <em>Cr&oelig;sus</em>,<br />
But how he'll leave it, Heaven bless us,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span><br />
I know not, nay, the trembling elf,<br />
May not as yet be sure himself;<br />
Though he, perhaps, may leave the whole<br />
To Charity, to save his soul.&mdash;<br />
Some folk have thought to make a will,<br />
Is signal given for Death to kill,<br />
But should he an intestate, die,<br />
The long expecting family,<br />
Will feed the greedy, gaping maw,<br />
Of griping, grinding, hungry Law.<br />
For though I am the next of kin,<br />
Such various claimants will rush in,<br />
Such troops of distant, country cousins,<br />
Will haste by scores, at least by dozens;<br />
So many Lawyers may appear,<br />
To promise each an ample share,<br />
That in what way these things may end,<br />
If fortune be my foe or friend,<br />
I wish, by all means, to ensure<br />
Some independent sinecure,<br />
And as you must the labour bear,<br />
You will a just advantage share.<br />
But not an atom of his wealth<br />
Must we attempt to take by stealth,<br />
No, though we could this night convey,<br />
As a sure, undiscover'd prey,<br />
His iron chest with all the gold<br />
And brilliant treasure it may hold.<br />
I only ask my views to aid<br />
But a small portion of his trade,<br />
And while above his riches flow,<br />
We may make mod'rate gains below,<br />
And what of that by us is done,<br />
Must be from funds which are our own."<br />
&mdash;The parties were at once agreed,<br />
And the scheme fail'd not to succeed:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span><br />
Nay, had stern fate the stroke delay'd,<br />
A decent fortune they had made;<br />
But as it was, their transient gain<br />
Gave them no reason to complain.<br />
&mdash;Now, ere twelve months or more were past,<br />
<span class="smcap">John Squeeze</span>, alas! had breath'd his last;<br />
And though they search'd the mansion round,<br />
A Will was no where to be found;<br />
And relatives in numbers came,<br />
Their rights to prove, their shares to claim;<br />
While the shrewd Miss <span class="smcap">Amelia Squeeze</span><br />
Lock'd ev'ry box and kept the keys.<br />
&mdash;With angry threats the house resounded,<br />
It was confusion worse confounded;<br />
While she secure in prudent savings,<br />
Calmly beheld their idle ravings,<br />
As different ways they did pursue,<br />
Which diff'rent Lawyers bade them do.<br />
&mdash;And here we cannot overlook<br />
The wary way the lady took.<br />
Her favourite swain, it must be known,<br />
A Pleader was of some renown;<br />
To whom this offer she propos'd,<br />
With which the learned Lawyer clos'd.<br />
"If of the wealth of Old <span class="smcap">John Squeeze</span>,<br />
Of whom you know I am the Niece,<br />
You prove me to be lawful Heir,<br />
My charms and fortune you shall share."<br />
&mdash;Thus she was left amid the paws<br />
Of Lawyers and the tardy Laws,<br />
With chance that when ten years were past,<br />
A husband she might get at last.<br />
&mdash;Not as such union often ends,<br />
She and <span class="smcap">Quæ Genus</span> parted friends:<br />
But ere Old <span class="smcap">Squeeze'em</span> was dispos'd,<br />
Ere the cold marble o'er him clos'd,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span><br />

From <i><span class="smcap">Jacob Levi</span>, Money-Lender</i>.<br />
He, having had some kind of feeling<br />
With <span class="smcap">John</span> in his usurious dealing,<br />
Observ'd <span class="smcap">Quæ Genus</span>, who had been<br />
Just such an useful go-between,<br />
As would find favour in the sight<br />
Of the keen, cautious Israelite,<br />
Who, therefore, with inviting grace,<br />
Offered him his vacant place.<br />
The proverb says it is a curse<br />
To go at once from bad to worse,<br />
And though, at first, he did not feel it,<br />
Time was determin'd to reveal it.<br />
&mdash;Of late, or more or less, 'tis true,<br />
Distress was in his frequent view,<br />
But then in its prevailing feature,<br />
It was but of a transient nature.<br />
A proud man for a whole week's date<br />
Might cease, perhaps, to eat off plate,<br />
Still, Dresden service could supply<br />
A varying scene of luxury:<br />
Or vanity might not resort<br />
To aid the splendour of a Court,<br />
From absent state of decoration,<br />
Required by certain rank and station:<br />
But, for a time, well-fram'd excuses<br />
Custom or fashion ne'er refuses;<br />
When soon again the plate is seen,<br />
The silver-smith has made it clean,<br />
And in a week, or month, or so,<br />
It will resume its usual show.<br />
Again the glitt'ring gems display<br />
At the gay Fête the dazzling ray,<br />
On having done the appointed duty<br />
To ease the wants of pride and beauty.

Give a smart twirl, nor fear to laugh:<br />
While coarser voices,&mdash;"hold your tongue,<br />

With all the garlands which he weav'd<br />
Ere Molly's letter was receiv'd:<br />
And all the fragrance of the flowers<br />
He thought to cull in Molly's bowers;<br />
Nay, which, but the preceding morning,<br />
